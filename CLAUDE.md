# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Claude Workbench is a comprehensive desktop GUI application for Claude CLI, built specifically for Windows with Tauri (Rust backend) and React TypeScript frontend. It provides an intuitive interface for AI-powered development workflows, project management, session handling, and MCP (Model Context Protocol) server management.

The application focuses on core Claude CLI integration optimized for Windows users, providing a streamlined experience for developers working with AI assistance on Windows platforms.

## Core Architecture

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)
- **Main App**: Multi-view application managing projects, sessions, agents, and settings
- **Core Components**: 
  - `FloatingPromptInput`: Central input interface with clipboard image support and thinking modes
  - `ClaudeCodeSession`: Real-time Claude interaction interface with session resumption and checkpoint management
  - `CCAgents`: Agent creation and management system with GitHub integration
  - `MCPManager`: MCP server configuration, testing, and project-specific management
  - `Settings`: Multi-tab configuration UI with theme switching, hooks, storage, and advanced settings
  - `HooksEditor`: Advanced shell command hooks for tool events with regex matching and templates
  - `StorageTab`: SQLite database viewer/editor for agent data and session history
  - `LanguageSelector`: Multi-language support with Chinese-first localization
  - `ClaudeStatusIndicator`: Real-time status monitoring for Claude processes

### Frontend Architecture
- **Context Management**: 
  - `ThemeContext`: OKLCH color space-based theme system with localStorage persistence
- **Custom Hooks**: 
  - `useTranslation`: Chinese-first internationalization with fallback support
- **State Management**: React Context providers for theme, output caching, and i18n
- **API Layer**: Type-safe Tauri invoke-based communication (`src/lib/api.ts`) with comprehensive error handling

### Backend (Rust/Tauri)
- **Commands Architecture**: Modular command handlers in `src-tauri/src/commands/`
  - `claude.rs`: Core Claude CLI integration with process lifecycle management and project hiding/restoration
  - `agents.rs`: Agent execution with GitHub integration and process monitoring
  - `mcp.rs`: MCP server lifecycle, configuration, and health monitoring
  - `clipboard.rs`: Clipboard image handling with temporary file management
  - `storage.rs`: SQLite database operations with query optimization
  - `slash_commands.rs`: Custom slash command system with autocomplete
  - `usage.rs`: Usage statistics and metrics tracking

## Data Flow Architecture

1. **Frontend → Backend**: Type-safe Tauri `invoke()` with comprehensive error handling
2. **Backend → CLI**: Process spawning with streaming output capture and health monitoring
3. **Database**: SQLite with automatic migrations and query optimization
4. **File System**: Scoped access with security policies (`$HOME/**`, `$TEMP/**`, `$TMP/**`)
5. **Image Pipeline**: Clipboard → Base64 → Temp files → Claude CLI paths with UNC path handling
6. **Project Management**: Hidden projects list stored in `~/.claude/hidden_projects.json`

## Development Commands

### Frontend Development
```bash
# Start development server (Vite)
bun run dev        # Preferred
npm run dev        # Alternative

# Build frontend only
bun run build      # Preferred
npm run build      # Alternative

# Type checking
npx tsc --noEmit

# Preview built frontend
npm run preview
```

### Tauri Development
```bash
# Start Tauri development (includes frontend auto-rebuild)
npm run tauri dev

# Build complete release application (REQUIRED for cross-device compatibility)
npm run tauri build

# Build Rust backend only (debug)
cd src-tauri && cargo build

# Build Rust backend only (release with optimizations)
cd src-tauri && cargo build --release --features custom-protocol

# Run Rust tests
cd src-tauri && cargo test

# Check Rust code formatting
cd src-tauri && cargo fmt --check

# Run Rust linter
cd src-tauri && cargo clippy
```

### Critical Build Requirements
- **ALWAYS use `npm run tauri build` for production/testing** - ensures cross-device compatibility
- **Bun is required for release builds** - npm builds may cause compatibility issues on other devices
- **Release builds use aggressive optimizations** - opt-level="z", LTO, strip symbols

### Key Build Outputs
- Executable: `src-tauri/target/release/claude-workbench.exe`
- MSI Installer: `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/msi/Claude Workbench_1.0.0_x64_en-US.msi`
- NSIS Installer: `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/nsis/Claude Workbench_1.0.0_x64-setup.exe`

## Architecture Patterns

### Frontend-Backend Communication
All communication uses Tauri's type-safe `invoke()` pattern:
```typescript
// Frontend with error handling
const result = await invoke<ReturnType>('command_name', { param: value });

// Backend with Result pattern
#[command]
async fn command_name(param: Type) -> Result<ReturnType, String>
```

### State Management
- **Global State**: React Context providers with TypeScript integration
- **Local State**: Component-specific state with hooks
- **Persistent State**: SQLite database with automatic migrations
- **Theme State**: OKLCH color space with localStorage persistence

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Rust Backend**: Comprehensive `Result<T, String>` pattern with detailed error messages
- **Frontend**: Type-safe error handling with user-friendly alerts
- **Process Management**: Graceful cleanup and recovery mechanisms

### Project Management System
- **Project Listing**: Dynamic scanning of `~/.claude/projects` directory
- **Project Hiding**: Non-destructive removal from project list using `hidden_projects.json`
- **Project Restoration**: Ability to restore hidden projects back to the list
- **File Preservation**: All project files and sessions are preserved when "deleting" projects

## Theme System

### OKLCH Color Space Implementation
```css
/* Enhanced theme with OKLCH color space for better perception */
:root, .dark {
  --color-background: oklch(0.12 0.01 240);
  --color-foreground: oklch(0.98 0.01 240);
  --color-muted-foreground: oklch(0.68 0.01 240);
}

.light {
  --color-background: oklch(0.99 0.005 240);
  --color-foreground: oklch(0.08 0.01 240);
  --color-muted-foreground: oklch(0.45 0.01 240);
}
```

### Theme Features
- **Dual Theme Support**: Light and dark themes with instant switching
- **Enhanced Contrast**: Improved readability in light theme with optimized contrast ratios
- **Backdrop Effects**: Advanced backdrop-blur with proper transparency handling
- **Chinese Font Support**: Comprehensive Chinese font stack with fallbacks
- **Accessibility**: WCAG-compliant contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum)

## Internationalization

### Chinese-First Strategy
- **Primary Language**: Chinese (zh) with comprehensive UI translation
- **Fallback Strategy**: Chinese → English for all missing translations
- **Detection Order**: localStorage → navigator → htmlTag
- **Implementation**: Direct Chinese text in components for better performance
- **Resources**: Comprehensive translation files in `src/i18n/locales/`

### Localization Implementation
```typescript
// i18n configuration
fallbackLng: 'zh',
lng: 'zh',
detection: {
  order: ['localStorage', 'navigator', 'htmlTag'],
  caches: ['localStorage'],
}
```
